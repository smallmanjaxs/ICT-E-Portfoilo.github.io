<td>First of all I’d like to thank Ms. Eden for teaching ICT. I’d like to also thank my parents for supporting me in school.
And of course, I’ll also thank God, for guiding me in school.
The lessons that I learned were XHTML, Lists, Tables, Hyperlinks, and HTML Forms.
The difficulties that I faced were remembering the attributes and properties of the tags.
I can use these skills by making an e-porfolio in ICT.
The most interesting lesson for me were forms because it surprised me that it is possible in HTML.
The things that I want to improve on are creating HTML codes faster and more precise.
Before 1st quarter, I didn't know that these tags are possible in HTML, Now I know that it is.
My future goals are expanding my knowledge in HTML.
Overall, this quarter is taught me how to create my very own webpage with forms, tables, and hyperlinks.</td>
